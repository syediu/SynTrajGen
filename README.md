### About This Repo

This repository contains the official implementation and dataset for the paper "SynTrajGen: A Synthetic Trajectory Generator for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Obstacles in UAV Navigation".

SynTrajGen is a parametric tool designed to generate diverse, 3D trajectories to train and benchmark forecasting models for UAV collision avoidance.

Below is an example trajectories for a few samples:
